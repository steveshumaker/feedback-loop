# Prime Digital Academy Feedback Loop 

## Description

This app is a simple feedback loop that asks for input from the user on a few simple metrics. It also gives the user the option to add comments.

The app will guide the user with conditional rendering of the next button, and also allows 'back' functionality. The app is deployed at: [feedback loop](https://redux-feedback-loop-06d6beceb5f1.herokuapp.com/#/), feel free to add your feedback!

### Below is an example of my thought process:
